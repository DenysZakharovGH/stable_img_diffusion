# Stable Diffusion: Efficient Text-to-Image Generation

## Installation
    1. Set up an Anaconda environment using the "environment.yaml" file from the project.
    2. Install all the necessary packages.
    3. Activate the environment to start using Stable Diffusion.
     
## Key Advantages Over the Original
    1. Efficient Diff Generation: Generate differential requests without the need for model reloading, enhancing the workflow efficiency.
    2. Seamless Implementation Integration: Utilize Stable Diffusion as a solid groundwork for implementing services, ensuring smooth integration into your projects.
    3. Optimized for Low Memory GPUs: Engineered for optimal performance on video adapters with limited memory capacity, expanding the reach of Stable Diffusion to a broader set of hardware.

    
##Getting Started
    - All the original functionalities are retained and improved upon.
    - To experience the enhanced implementation:
        - Run the command: python optimizedSD/optimized_txt2img.py
        - After loading the local model "model 1.3.ckpt," enter your desired input for image generation.
        - Find the generated results in the "outputs/txt2img-samples" directory.


Example of generation the request "ocean from rocks"
